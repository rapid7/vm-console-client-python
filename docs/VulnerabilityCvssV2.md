# VulnerabilityCvssV2

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**access_complexity** | **str** | Access Complexity (AC) component which measures the complexity of the attack required to exploit the vulnerability once an attacker has gained access to the target system.  | Access Complexity       | Description                                                              |  | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |  | High (&#x60;\&quot;H\&quot;&#x60;)            | Specialized access conditions exist.                                     |  | Medium (&#x60;\&quot;M\&quot;&#x60;)          | The access conditions are somewhat specialized.                          |  | Low (&#x60;\&quot;L\&quot;&#x60;)             | Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. | | [optional] 
**access_vector** | **str** | Access Vector (Av) component which reflects how the vulnerability is exploited.  | Access Vector              | Description |  | -------------------------- | ----------- |  | Local (&#x60;\&quot;L\&quot;&#x60;)              | A vulnerability exploitable with only local access requires the attacker to have either physical access to the vulnerable system or a local (shell) account. |  | Adjacent Network (&#x60;\&quot;A\&quot;&#x60;)   | A vulnerability exploitable with adjacent network access requires the attacker to have access to either the broadcast or collision domain of the vulnerable software. |  | Network (&#x60;\&quot;N\&quot;&#x60;)            | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed \&quot;remotely exploitable\&quot;. |   | [optional] 
**authentication** | **str** | Authentication (Au) component which measures the number of times an attacker must authenticate to a target in order to exploit a vulnerability.  | Authentication       | Description |  | -------------------- | ----------- |  | Multiple (&#x60;\&quot;M\&quot;&#x60;)     | Exploiting the vulnerability requires that the attacker authenticate two or more times, even if the same credentials are used each time. |  | Single (&#x60;\&quot;S\&quot;&#x60;)       | The vulnerability requires an attacker to be logged into the system.                                                                     |  | None (&#x60;\&quot;N\&quot;&#x60;)         | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability.                                                                             | | [optional] 
**availability_impact** | **str** | Availability Impact (A) component which measures the impact to availability of a successfully exploited vulnerability.  | Availability Impact        | Description  |  | -------------------------- | ------------ |  | None (&#x60;\&quot;N\&quot;&#x60;)               | There is no impact to the availability of the system. |  | Partial (&#x60;\&quot;P\&quot;&#x60;)            | There is reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. |  | Complete (&#x60;\&quot;C\&quot;&#x60;)           | There is a total shutdown of the affected resource. The attacker can render the resource completely unavailable. | | [optional] 
**confidentiality_impact** | **str** | Confidentiality Impact (C) component which measures the impact on confidentiality of a successfully exploited vulnerability.  | Confidentiality Impact     | Description  |  | -------------------------- | ------------ |  | None (&#x60;\&quot;N\&quot;&#x60;)               | There is no impact to the confidentiality of the system. |  | Partial (&#x60;\&quot;P\&quot;&#x60;)            | There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. |  | Complete (&#x60;\&quot;C\&quot;&#x60;)           | There is total information disclosure, resulting in all system files being revealed. The attacker is able to read all of the system&#39;s data (memory, files, etc.) |  | [optional] 
**exploit_score** | **float** | The CVSS exploit score. | [optional] 
**impact_score** | **float** | The CVSS impact score. | [optional] 
**integrity_impact** | **str** | Integrity Impact (I) component measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability.  | Integrity Impact           | Description  |  | -------------------------- | ------------ |  | None (&#x60;\&quot;N\&quot;&#x60;)               | There is no impact to the integrity of the system. |  | Partial (&#x60;\&quot;P\&quot;&#x60;)            | Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. |  | Complete (&#x60;\&quot;C\&quot;&#x60;)           | There is a total compromise of system integrity. There is a complete loss of system protection, resulting in the entire system being compromised. The attacker is able to modify any files on the target system. | | [optional] 
**score** | **float** | The CVSS score, which ranges from 0-10. | [optional] 
**vector** | **str** | The &lt;a target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot; rel&#x3D;\&quot;noopener noreferrer\&quot; href&#x3D;\&quot;https://www.first.org/cvss/v2/guide\&quot;&gt;CVSS v2&lt;/a&gt; vector. | [optional]
